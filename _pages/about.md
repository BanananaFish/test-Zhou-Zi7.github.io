This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

Research Interests
======
As a researcher in the field of artificial intelligence, my primary interest lies in the area of AI security. Specifically, I am interested in the study of adversarial samples and backdoor attacks, with a recent focus on the security of pre-trained large models and the vulnerability of image segmentation and object detection to adversarial attacks. My research aims to develop robust and secure AI systems that can withstand various types of attacks and ensure the safety and reliability of AI applications. Through my work, I hope to contribute to the advancement of AI security and establish a more secure and trustworthy AI ecosystem.
